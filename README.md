Weld Design Evaluation

## About
The following project encompasses the investigation of the requirement of a suitable beam and carry out weld design to secure the denoted baseplate. A beam is to be selected with restrictions upon volumetic dimensions highlighted in sections below. Selection process is documented in the report below. Furthermore, this investigation will include the justification of the selected beam to minimise various properties of the beam through methods of analysis. Finally, this investigation will also justify the weld profile and size of the beam. 

This investigation will include the jusitification of the selected beam to minimise various undesirable effects of loads and ensure security while balancing cost and manufacturing process through a method of analysis. The specific final values will include a weld profile and specifications.
