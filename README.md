Weld Design Evaluation

## About
The following project encompasses the investigation of the requirement of a suitable beam and carry out weld design to secure the denoted baseplate. A beam is to be selected with restrictions upon volumetic dimensions highlighted in sections below. Selection process is documented in the report. Furthermore, this investigation will include the justification of the selected beam to minimise various properties of the beam through methods of analysis. Finally, this investigation will also justify the weld profile and size of the beam. 

This investigation will include the jusitification of the selected beam to minimise various undesirable effects of loads and ensure security while balancing cost and manufacturing process through a method of analysis. The specific final values will include a weld profile and specifications.

## Overview

The project focuses on the selection of a suitable beam and the design of its welded connection to a baseplate. The selection process considers volumetric constraints and aims to minimize undesirable effects such as excessive stress and deformation. The weld design ensures that the connection can safely transmit the applied loads without failure.

## Project Objectives

- Select an appropriate beam profile within specified volumetric dimensions.
- Design a weld that securely connects the beam to the baseplate.
- Justify the beam selection and weld design through analytical methods.
- Ensure the design meets safety and performance criteria under expected loading conditions.
## Design Methodology

- **Beam Selection**: Evaluate various beam profiles considering factors such as strength, stiffness, and dimensional constraints.
- **Weld Design**: Determine the appropriate weld size and profile to ensure adequate load transfer between the beam and baseplate.
- **Material Considerations**: Select suitable materials for both the beam and weld to achieve desired mechanical properties.

## Analysis Techniques

- **Stress Analysis**: Calculate stresses in the beam and weld under applied loads to ensure they are within allowable limits.
- **Deflection Analysis**: Assess the beam's deflection to ensure it meets serviceability requirements.
- **Safety Factors**: Apply appropriate safety factors to account for uncertainties in loading conditions and material properties.

## Applications

- **Structural Engineering**: Design of welded connections in buildings, bridges, and other structures.
- **Mechanical Systems**: Integration of welded components in machinery and equipment.
- **Educational Purposes**: Demonstrating principles of weld design and structural analysis in engineering curricula.
